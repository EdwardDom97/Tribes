#Tribes 
#A top down building game
#start date 10/28/2023

'''

I had a fair idea where I create a top down building game, one of the mechanics is rune stones and rune dust inspired by the minecraft mod the runic dust mod,
which is no longer around.anyways, there is an huge island with a few mixed biomes, there are plants, tress, the typical flora and fauna. I am thinking of a style
similar to realm of the mad god mixed with a child of minecraft and terraria. The player starts off with the bare minimum by being washed up on the beach. The game 
is not necessarily intended to be survival against mobs, but they will be there to hinder the player and provide a combat purpose. The name will be Tribes. The
map itself will be the same and so will the biomes, but certain objects like plants, structures, objects, enemies, treasures, and passive mobs could be randomly
generated at one point.
